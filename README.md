## Overview

This project is called **"Asian Kitchen's Menu"** and was created as a part of the [Patika and Kodluyoruz Frontend-Beginner-Path]([https://www.kodluyoruz.org](https://academy.patika.dev/courses/javascript/object-nesne-nedir-nasil-olusturulur)) Frontend Web Development course assignments.

The aim of the project was to dynamically display a menu list using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript** based on provided resources.

## üß† What I Did

- I created a **menu array** in JavaScript to store food data (title, category, price, image, description).
- Used **`filter()`** to categorize items dynamically (e.g., Korea, Japan, China).
- Used **`innerHTML`** to inject HTML content into the DOM dynamically using `template literals`.
- Added responsive design and styling with **Bootstrap** (grid, cards, buttons).
- Integrated buttons for filtering by cuisine type.
- Used **event listeners** for category-based interactivity.
